                <h3>Why Processing?</h3>
                <h4 class="about-description">Processing was built specifically for those who want to learn programming in
                    a simple way yet visual so learners can easily understand programming concepts. Most of the Java syntaxes
                    have been simplified in a way that they are easily understandable. Digital Media Program in the College
                    of Professional Studies uses Processing as a tool to teach the basic concept of programming. This website
                    was built so that you can learn basic programming concepts easily using Processing. </h4>
